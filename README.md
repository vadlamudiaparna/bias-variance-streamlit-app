## Bias-Variance Streamlit App
This project contains a Streamlit application that provides an interactive visualization to explore the concepts of bias and variance in machine learning.

## Key Features
Scenario Selection: Users can choose from a set of pre-defined bias and variance scenarios.
Dynamic Simulations: The app simulates a dart throwing exercise, visually demonstrating how bias and variance impact the distribution of results.
Educational Explanations: Includes clear text descriptions of each scenario and its implications for machine learning model performance.

## Project Structure
bias_variance_app.py: Contains the main Streamlit application code.
requirements.txt: Lists the required Python libraries.

## Description of Scenarios
Scenario 1: Low Bias, Low Variance
Description: Represents an ideal model with high accuracy and low generalization error.
Simulation Behavior: Darts cluster tightly around the center of the target.

Scenario 2: High Bias, Low Variance
Description: Represents a model that might underfit the data, leading to consistently inaccurate predictions.
Simulation Behavior: Darts cluster tightly but off-center.

Scenario 3: Low Bias, High Variance
Description: Represents a model that might be capturing too much noise from the data, leading to inconsistent predictions.
Simulation Behavior: Darts spread widely across the target.

Scenario 4: High Bias, High Variance
Description: Represents a model that is likely performing poorly due to both inaccurate and inconsistent predictions.
Simulation Behavior: Darts spread widely and off-center.
